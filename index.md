### EXPERIENCE

#### Senior Data Scientist 05/2022-present
EXL Service Canada, Inc., Ontario, Canada<br/>
- Build models for the prediction of high risk and high-cost cohorts and offer strategies to stakeholders by working with medical and pharmacy claim big data and leveraging data cleansing, discretization, outlier treatment, variable selection, machine learning algorithms etc.
- Summarize analysis and create presentations that represent the insightful outcomes effectively in a concise and understandable manner. 
- Collaborate with the team and mentor juniors on multiple projects to guarantee timely solution delivery to clients. 



### PROJECTS

#### Credit Risk Analysis and Modeling
- Cleaned 50,000 real-world credit card application records by using various methods to fill missing values and exclude outliers.
- Used grid search and cross validation to find the best parameters for logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost. Then compared three models’ performance by using ROC curve and confusion matrix.
- Calculated the defaulter accuracy and total loss for each cut off point between 0.4 and 0.9 with a step of 0.05 and then developed a two-point cut-off strategy to assist the bank in minimizing total loss.

#### Analysis of LiDAR Images with the Health Deprivation Index
- Examined the relationship between LiDAR images and the health deprivation index using transfer learning approaches based on VGG16 and ResNet50V2, respectively.
- Enhanced the performance metric by adopting a multimodal learning strategy that combined unstructured LiDAR data with structured area code data.
- Highlighted the regions of photos where the model picked up as important features using Grad-CAM.

#### New York City (NYC) motor vehicle collision forecast 
- Collected, cleaned and structured real-world 450,000 historical collision records from NYC OpenData website.
- Developed models to extract insights from time-series data, like trend, seasonality.
- Derived insights by Wordcloud text analysis about the main collision reasons including “inattention distraction”, “following closely” and “failure to yield”. 
- Deployed a real-time web app using Flask on Heroku cloud application platform to automatically request real-time collision data and then feed data into the pre-trained models to predict collision numbers in the five boroughs of NYC one week later. 
- Available to the public at website: https://nyc-collision-forecast.herokuapp.com/ 

#### Movie recommendation system design
-	Analyzed a textual dataset of 58,000 movies reviewed by 280,000 individuals to create a movie recommendation engine.
-	Overcame the dimensional curse by using feature engineering. 
-	Served a user with similar movies by computing "average" features based on the user's previous movie preferences and pairing movies with feature similarity.
