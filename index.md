### PROJECTS

#### New York City (NYC) motor vehicle collision forecast 
- Collected, cleaned and structured real-world 450,000 historical collision records from NYC OpenData website.
- Developed models to extract insights from time-series data, like trend, seasonality.
- Derived insights by Wordcloud text analysis about the main collision reasons including “inattention distraction”, “following closely” and “failure to yield”. 
- Deployed a real-time web app using Flask on Heroku cloud application platform to automatically request real-time collision data and then feed data into the pre-trained models to predict collision numbers in the five boroughs of NYC one week later.

#### Movie recommendation system design
- Developed a movie recommendation system by analyzing textual dataset of 58,000 movies rated by 280,000 users.
- Used feature engineering to overcome the dimensional curse and wrote object-oriented classes to wrap functions together. 
- Recommended similar movies to a user by calculating “average” features from the user’s historical movie preference and matching movies with feature similarity.
